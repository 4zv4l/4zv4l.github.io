After a long time (almost a year!) I am writing again. It took me some time to 
get fully installed in Hong Kong (I moved from Belgium to Hong Kong on July 18).

I enjoyed 3 months of "holiday" there while looking for a job and now I am fully installed !

Anyway, this (very short) post is about a nice language I discovered few months ago named Janet (yes like in _The Good Place_).

The language looks like this:

```janet
(defn main [& args]
  (unless (= (length args) 4)
    ((eprintf "usage: %s [ip] [port] [hash file]" (args 0))
     (os/exit 1)))
  (def [ip port file] [(get args 1) (scan-number (get args 2)) (get args 3)])
  (printf "Initialise db with %s" file)
  (db-helper/initdb file)
  (def server (net/listen ip port :datagram))
  (printf "Listening on %s:%d" ip port)
  (while true
    (var buffer @"")
    (def client (net/recv-from server 1024 buffer))
    (match (peg/match peg-helper/hash-grammar (string/trim buffer))
      ["GET"] (send-hash server client)
      ["POST" hash password] (recv-hash server client hash password)
      _ (printf "got garbage from a client: %q" buffer))))
```

What I like about Janet is its very similar to [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) but with a larger stdlib.
I also really like the package/binary manager called [jpm](https://janet-lang.org/docs/jpm.html), I find the syntax really easy to understand, for example for the project [janbreak5](https://github.com/4zv4l/janbreak5/tree/dev) that I made with a friend, here is how the `project.janet` looks like

```janet
(declare-project
  :name "janbreak5"
  :description ```simple md5 breaker client/server in Janet/C```
  :dependencies ["https://github.com/joy-framework/db"
                 "https://github.com/janet-lang/sqlite3"])

(declare-executable
  :name "server"
  :entry "server/server.janet"
  :lflags ["-lcrypto"])

(declare-native
  :name "md5"
  :source ["md5/md5.c"]
  :ldflags ["-lcrypto"])
```

The project mixes `C` (md5 library) and `Janet` (server/client binaries).

Janet is mostly implemented in `C99`, it is very easy to cross compile `Janet` for different OS or Architecture.

There is a very nice book available for free online which will do a much better job than me at convincing you to try Janet, [Janet for Mortals](https://janet.guide/), the "book" is even interactive so you can try some Janet without installing it while reading !
