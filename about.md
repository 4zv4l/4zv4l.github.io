I am 4zv4l, currently working as pentester and malware analyst in Hong Kong.

I specifically like coding low level software and anything related to security.  
I also enjoy reverse engineering and bug bounty.  
I am more a Linux person but can also administrate Windows infra.  

I enjoy coding in:
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
For low level or precise programming.
- [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
For quick or high level programming.
- [Perl](https://www.perl.org/)
For really quick programming/scripting.
