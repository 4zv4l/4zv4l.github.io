I am 4zv4l, student in cyber security in Namur.

I specifically like coding low level or security oriented software.  
I also enjoy reverse engineering and bug bounty.  
I am more a Linux person but can also administrate Windows AD.  

I enjoy coding in:
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
For low level or precise programming.
- [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
For quick or high level programming.
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
For really quick programming/scripting.

But I still can code in Python, Bash, Powershell, C, SQL, PHP and Go :)
